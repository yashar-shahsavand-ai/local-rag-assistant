Vacation Vesting: After 5 years of service, vacation days become non-repayable; leaving before this threshold requires repayment of all used days. IT Policy: Company-issued devices must be used exclusively for work. Personal software installation is prohibited. All data must be encrypted; remote wipe is authorized if devices are lost. Employees must report security incidents within 1 hour. Unauthorized internet use (e.g., torrenting) results in immediate suspension.
